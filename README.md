# Python
All practices of python goes here from now on(2017/7/31)

As I will be heading to the US to study in the field of Information Sciences, Masters of Science in Information Management/ Data Science & Data Analytics at UIUC iSchool, I gathered a few tiny practices and projects
from my past undergraduate years and pushed them to github for documentation and for further usage. (Currently still looking for other
projects as I have changed my pc 3 times (Sometimes things get a bit messy as I have crossed over from WindowsOS to MacOS at the time when I still count as a newbie towards computer science and Information) due to certain things)
