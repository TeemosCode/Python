# Python
All practices of python goes here from now on(2017/7/31)

As I will be heading to the US to study in the field of Information Sciences at UIUC iSchool, I gathered a few tiny practices and projects
from my past undergraduate years and pushed them to github for documentation and for further usage. (Currently still looking for other
projects as I have changed my pc 3 times (once even crossed over from WindowsOS to MacOS) due to certain things)
