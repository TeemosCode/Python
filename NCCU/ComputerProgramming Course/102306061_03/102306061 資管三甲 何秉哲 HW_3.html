				Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format which is both human-readable 
				and machine-readable. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality and usability across the Internet.
				It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. 
				Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.

			<ul>
				<li style = "color: red;">
					Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within Internet-based, two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers. KML was developed for use with Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer.
				</li>
				<li style = "color: red;">
					KML became an international standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium in 2008
